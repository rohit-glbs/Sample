## 👨🏻‍💻 Agent Service

The **Agent Service** is a key part of the [EmpMonitor](https://empmonitor.com/) system. It is acting as the bridge between employee devices (where the agent software is installed) and the backend. Its primary role is to manage communication, ensuring that data collected from employee devices such as **app usage**, **web activity**, **screen time**, **keystrokes**, **file access**, **system logs**, and **attendance tracking** is transmitted securely and efficiently to the backend for processing. The service handles agent authentication, verifying the identity of each device to ensure only authorized agents can connect, preventing unauthorized access. This authentication process is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the system.

Additionally, the Agent Service ensures data security by using encryption and secure protocols to protect sensitive information during transmission. It also checks and validates incoming data to ensure it’s accurate and complete before sending it to other backend services, like the [[README - Store]], for further processing. By handling these tasks, the Agent Service plays a key role in keeping the EmpMonitor system *_reliable_*, *_secure_*, and *_efficient_*, *_ensuring smooth_* and *_seamless communication_* between employee devices and the backend.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Agent Service is built to manage large amounts of data quickly, enabling real-time monitoring and growth. However, setting it up correctly and ensuring enough resources are available is essential to keep it running smoothly and securely.

## ➤ Pre-Requisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:


| 🛠️ Requirement | 📌 Version |

> Properly configure and scale your systems to prevent performance issues and data transmission delays

## ➤ What does it do?

- **Talks to Agents**: It communicates with the agent software on employee devices to collect activity data (like app usage or web activity).

- **Data Validation**: It checks the data received from agents to ensure it's accurate and complete.

- **Encryption**: It encrypts sensitive data to protect it during transmission.

- **Checks Security**: It makes sure only authorized devices can connect by using secure authentication.

- **Handles Errors** : It manages issues like network problems or device disconnections and keeps logs for debugging.

- **Data Storage**: It sends the collected data to the Store service for further analysis and processing.

## ➤ How it works?

- **Data Collection**: The agent software installed on employee devices collects activity data (like app usage, web activity, or screen time) and sends it to the *_Agent Service_*.

- **Authorization & Validation**: The Agent Service first checks if the agent is authorized to connect. It then validates the data to ensure it’s accurate and complete.

  

- **Data Forwarding**: Once the data is validated, it is sent to the *_Store Service_* for storage and further processing.

  

- **Logging & Monitoring**: Every step, from data receipt to validation and forwarding, is logged. These logs are used for monitoring the system and debugging any issues that may arise.
## ➤ Installation Guide

For a comprehensive, step-by-step installation process applicable to all our backend modules, please refer to our [[Installation - Backend]]

#### The guide covers:

- System requirements

- Dependency installations

- Database configurations

- Project setup steps

  
  

<!-- ##  Installation Process

  

This guide will walk you through the installation process step by step, designed for users with minimal technical background. By following these instructions carefully, you'll be able to set up the software independently.

  
  

### Step 1: Requirement Check  

Before installing the software, ensure that your system meets the following requirements.

  

#### 1. Node.js

- Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. Run the following command to check if Node.js is installed on your system.

- Open your computer's terminal or command prompt and type:

   ```sh

      node -v

   ```

   - ✔️ Expected output: `NodeJS 14.x` or later.

> [!TIP]

>

> If NodeJS is not installed, visit [NodeJS Official Website and download](https://nodejs.org/en) the LTS (Long Term Support) version.

  
  

#### 2. NPM (Node Package Manager)

- NPM helps install required dependencies. To verify its installation, use the command below:

   ```sh

      npm -v

   ```

   - ✔️ Expected output: `NPM 7.x.x` or later.

> [!NOTE]

>

> Installing Node.js also installs NPM.

  
  

#### 3. Redis

- Redis is a database that speeds up application performance. Check if it is installed by running:

   ```sh

      redis-server --version

   ```

   - ✔️ Expected output: Redis version information.

   - If Redis is not installed, download and install it from the [official Redis website](https://redis.io/downloads/)

  

> [!WARNING]

>

> Redis is crucial for caching and real-time features. Ensure it's properly installed.

  

#### 4. MongoDB

- MongoDB is a NoSQL database required for storing data. To check if it is installed, run:

   ```sh

      mongod --version

   ```

   - ✔️ Expected output: MongoDB version information.

   - If MongoDB is not installed, download and install it from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

  

#### 5. MariaDB

- MariaDB is a relational database management system. Verify its installation with the following command:

   ```sh

      mysql --version

   ```

   - ✔️ Expected output: MariaDB version information.

   - If MariaDB is not installed, download and install it from the [official MariaDB website](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&p=mariadb&r=11.7.2&os=windows&cpu=x86_64&pkg=msi&mirror=bharat)

  

> [!WARNING]

>

> Ensure all these software components are installed before proceeding!

<!-- Step 2 begins from here

### Step 2: Set Up NodeJS Project

  

#### 1. Create Project Directory

- Creating a dedicated directory helps organize your project and keeps all related files in one place. This step prepares the foundation for your software installation.

   ```bash

      # This command creates a new directory and moves into it

      mkdir employee-monitor

      cd employee-monitor

   ```

  

#### 2. Initialize Node Project

- Initializing a Node project sets up the basic configuration files needed for your application. The -y flag automatically accepts default settings.

   ```bash

      # Creates a new Node.js project with default settings

      npm init -y

   ```

  

---

  

<!-- step 3 begins here

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

#### 1. Backend Dependencies

Dependencies are external packages required for the software to function correctly. To install all necessary dependencies, use the following command:

   ```sh

      npm install

   ```

> [!TIP]

>

> This step might take a few minutes. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

  
  
  
  

---

<!-- Step 4 begins here

### Step 4: Generate Application Key

#### 1. Generate Key

- Laravel requires an application key for security purposes. To generate this key, run the following command:

   ```sh

      php artisan key:generate

   ```

   - ✔️ Expected output: Application key set successfully.

> [!WARNING]

>

> If you skip this step, your application may not function correctly.

  
  
  
  

---

 <!-- Step 5 starts here

 ### Step 5: Configure the Database

#### 1. MariaDB Setup

- To create a new database in MariaDB, follow these steps:

   - Ensure MariaDB is running.

   - Open a terminal and log in to MariaDB:

  ```sh

      mysql -u root -p

  ```

  - Enter your MariaDB root password.

  - Create a new database by running:

  ```sh

      CREATE DATABASE empmonitor;

      EXIT;

  ```

  

#### 2. MongoDB Setup

- MongoDB does not require manual table creation. To set up a database, use the following commands:

   ```sh

      mongo

      use empmonitor;

      exit;

   ```

> [!TIP]

>

> Laravel will handle collections automatically.

  
  

#### 3. Redis Setup

- To check if Redis is running, execute the following command:

   ```sh

      redis-cli ping

   ```

   - ✔️ Expected output: `PONG`

- If Redis is not running, start it with:

   ```sh

      redis-server

   ```

> [!TIP]

>

> Keep Redis running in the background for better performance.

  

---

### Step 6: Compile Backend Assets

- To bundle application assets and start the development server, use the command below:

   ```sh

      npm run start:dev

   ```

   - Expected Output: Vite server running at `http://localhost:5173`
